Some experiments with the TM4C123G board and labs of the edX course [Embedded Systems](https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-world-utaustinx-ut-6-02x).

# Building the examples

The script build-arm.sh allows to build the code from the command line in \*NIX (I have tested it just in Mac).

Some prerequisites are required, though. I followed [this guide](http://recursive-labs.com/blog/2012/10/28/stellaris-launchpad-gnu-linux-getting-started/) to install them.

Happy hacking :)
